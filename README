Programming Assignment #1
Due 9-18-17 11:00 PM

Write a pthread program to sum a random array of 1000 integers. Your 
program should split the array into k segments, 
and each of the k threads will sum over that segment of the array. The segment sums should be stored in a global 
array called a of type integer and size of 1000.

Input:

From the command line the user will provide file (named: input.txt ) where the numbers to sum will be read into an array 
and the number of threads to create.

For example:

./a.out input.txt 7

In this case, the numbers will be read into from the file input.txt. Note that this file may contain a total number of integers that is 
not a multiple of k.

Output:

Simply output the total sum.

Hint: Consider pmax.cpp

Name your program 0.cpp and be sure to place it in your pgm directory.
